Week 01 January 11, 2016
_________
This week was extremely busy for me. One of the main thing that I accomplished was getting my work and 
personal life organized. Since it was the first week after a break, I had to get back to learning routine. 
Professor Robin gave me some tips during discussion’s feedback about getting used to the format of the class, 
and planning things ahead with a plain calendar. This week I did a research over Snapchat founders. While 
doing an inspiring research story, I found more motivation to success. This week I had a crazy work schedule. 
I worked 10 hours a day. It was hard for me to get an assignment done everyday since I have been used to the way 
of my previous classes when all assignments are due at the end of the week. I would work on my assignments during 
my lunch break at work. I won’t have to worry about it anymore since I have change my schedule.

Week two summery

I have to increase my time on the instructions of assignments. I misuderstood the instructions for this week's 
call to action assignment. I was suppose to write a failure to success story, instead of just a success story. I am very
disappointed with my progress for this week. I tried to keep my personal life away from school and work, but I had
some emergency issues.
