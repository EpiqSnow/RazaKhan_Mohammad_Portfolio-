# RazaKhan_Mohammad_Portfolio-


The purpose of this portfolio is to have all my work and codes saved. I will use GitHub to store my codes and version of the changes that I apply to it.
The meaning is that I'll have all changes saved in a database called repository. In repository, the changes are saved every time one edits a working file. It's like a time travel.
